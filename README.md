## Notes about local development

Set up project

```
npm install
```

Run local dev server

```
npm run dev
```

To test this on a standalone device such as an Oculus Quest 2, use ngrok to to tunnel the local dev server to an endpoint. I have ngrok installed at `c://DevTools/`

```
c://DevTools/ngrok.exe http 3000
```
