    <p>Everything about this project is a work in progress.</p>
    <p>
      This loosely structured project is a place where I can prototype and
      experiment with UI/UX for spatial interfaces. Some of my ideas include:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Using Babylon JS with the Vue 3 Composition API and script setup</li>
      <li>Reactive data on Babylon JS GUI</li>
      <li>Reactive/interactive controls with Babylon JS GUI</li>
      <li>
        Laying out data in 3D Building controls for common data editing tasks
      </li>
      <li>
        Navigating data as if each record were an object in 3D Exploring
        productive workflows
      </li>
      <li>
        Replacing some of the flat-screen work that I do in various apps and
        sites
      </li>
      <li>Working with various APIs and databases</li>
      <li>Detailing and documenting common Babylon GUI workflows</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The unit of account for this project is the <em>lab</em>. Each lab is a
      place where I can explore a concept or idea. In Vue terms, each lab will
      be a page or component that we can navigate to. I wonâ€™t write a post for
      every lab.
    </p>
    <p>Each lab contains a Babylon JS scene, a title, and some notes.</p>
    <p>
      Check the code for each lap for more details. The repo is
